# Climate Change Impact Analysis: A Comparative Study of Chicago and Miami (2010-2022)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes the effects of climate change in two major U.S. cities, **Chicago** and **Miami**, over a 13-year period (2010-2022). The analysis focuses on key environmental parameters such as **temperature trends, UV index variations, precipitation patterns, and wind speed dynamics**. Using advanced data visualization and statistical methods, this study aims to uncover trends, correlations, and anomalies that impact urban sustainability and climate resilience.

## üìä Key Findings & Visualizations
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Correlation Analysis
- Heatmaps generated to understand relationships between climate variables.
- Example: The correlation between **UV index and temperature** showed a strong seasonal trend.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Climate Variability & Trends
- **Temperature fluctuations** indicate a rising trend in Miami, while Chicago shows significant seasonal shifts.
- **Precipitation patterns** reveal increasing rainfall variability in both cities.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering Analysis (Fuzzy C-Means)
- Miami and Chicago exhibit distinct climate clusters based on **temperature and UV radiation**.
- Clustering highlights seasonal shifts and long-term climate changes.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Regression Models
- Joint regression plots demonstrate the relationship between **surface temperature and atmospheric temperature variations**.
- Predictive models suggest that **Miami's warming trend is more pronounced** compared to Chicago.
